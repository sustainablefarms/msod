# linking-data
Repo for scripts from the 'Linking Data' project, aimed at predicting farm biodiversity using remote sensing products


## Research Plans
 + develop a crude 'grazing pressure' metric (1 week of Kassel's time)
   + model GPP as a response variable of rainfall with a lag
   + one model fitted using all data location
     + use location as a mixed effect
   + for each location, use the residual as a predictor to predict biodiversity.

 + Initially use predictors that are easy to acquire
   + put moderate effort into investigating models that use these predictors
   + see what comes out


## Logistics Plans
 + Create a clean version of the research data
 + Share interesting papers using a Zotero shared library
